# Monty Hall Problem Simulator
Imagine a gameshow where you're presented with three doors - one of them has a bunch of money behind it, the other two nothing. You choose your door - then the gameshow host opens one of the other doors and reveals it has nothing behind it. She then give you the chance to change your guess to the remaining unopened door. Do you do it?

Is it worth it to change your guess? Run a few thousand simulated games and find out!
